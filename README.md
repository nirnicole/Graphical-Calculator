# Graphical-Calculator
 shows polynomials and clicked points

we had 2 school projects this semester in java,
the one was to implement polynomials and calculate them.
the second was to show a point on a graph when a click on the panel has been detected.

while working on the latter I thought to my self, why not combine those two?
the final result is this graphical polynomial calculator which still lets you draw points as requested,
it's still in development and I'm happy to share it!

note:
it's not finished so I have not yet to code review it,
there's still some missing documentation, utilization, and I need to change the GUI model to MVC.

enjoy!
